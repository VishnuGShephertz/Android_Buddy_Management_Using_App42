# Design Details:

All source code communication with App42 API is written in  App42ServiceApi.java file.

__Initialize Services:__ At first you have to register on App42 using your APIKEY and SECRETKEY keys. And have to intialiaze all services first.

```
   
		App42API.initialize(context, Constants.App42ApiKey,
				Constants.App42ApiSecret);
		this.userService = App42API.buildUserService();
		this.buddyService = App42API.buildBuddyService();
		this.avatarService = App42API.buildAvatarService();
		this.uploadService=App42API.buildUploadService();
		App42CacheManager.setPolicy(Policy.NETWORK_FIRST);
		App42API.setOfflineStorage(true);
	
```
__Registering User:__ To use application first you have to register for this application by passing your userName, password and email-id.
```
   
	public void createUser(final String name, final String pswd,
			final String email, final UserEventListener callBack) {
		final Handler callerThreadHandler = new Handler();
		new Thread() {
			@Override
			public void run() {
				try {
					final User user = userService.createUser(name, pswd, email);
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							callBack.onUserCreated(user);
						}
					});
				} catch (final App42Exception ex) {
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							if (callBack != null) {
								callBack.onUserCreated(null);
							}
						}
					});

				}
			}
		}.start();
	}
	
```
__Authenticate User:__ Once you register with this app, next time authenticate yourself by passing userName and password.
```
public void authenticateUser(final String name, final String pswd,
			final UserEventListener callBack) {
		final Handler callerThreadHandler = new Handler();
		new Thread() {
			@Override
			public void run() {
				try {
					final App42Response response = userService.authenticate(
							name, pswd);
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							callBack.onUserAuthenticated(response);
						}
					});
				} catch (final App42Exception ex) {
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							if (callBack != null) {
								System.out.println(ex.toString());
								callBack.onUserAuthenticated(null);
							}
						}
					});
				}
			}
		}.start();
	}
```

__Create Your Avatar:__ You can also create your own Avatar.
```

public void createAvatar(final String userName, final String avatarName,
			final String imagePath, final String description,
			final AvatarEventListener callBack) {
		final Handler callerThreadHandler = new Handler();
		new Thread() {
			@Override
			public void run() {
				try {
					final Avatar avatar = avatarService.createAvatar(
							avatarName, userName, imagePath, description);
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							callBack.onAvatarCreated(avatar);
						}
					});
				} catch (final App42Exception ex) {
					callerThreadHandler.post(new Runnable() {
						@Override
						public void run() {
							if (callBack != null) {
								System.out.println(ex.toString());
								callBack.onAvatarCreationFailed(ex);
							}
						}
					});
				}
			}
		}.start();
	}
